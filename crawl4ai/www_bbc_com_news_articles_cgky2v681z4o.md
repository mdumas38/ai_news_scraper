# ‘I want to see her challenged’ - swing voters unconvinced by Harris
interview

Kamala Harris’s first interview since becoming the Democratic presidential
candidate was an opportunity to introduce herself - and her campaign’s message
- to Americans who say they do not yet know her or for what she stands.

The vice-president defended her record in the White House and addressed
questions about a series of policy shifts since she first ran for the top job
in 2019 during the CNN interview on Thursday.

Ms Harris and her running mate - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who joined her
for the interview - have enjoyed a surge of enthusiasm from Democrats in
recent weeks, but the campaign knows they must win over undecided voters to
win November’s election.

Young men are a significant proportion of those persuadable voters, and a
group that Republican Donald Trump has been aggressively targeting with a slew
of recent media appearances on podcasts that boast audiences that are largely
young and male.

Given the battle for their vote, what did three of them make of Ms Harris’s
first sit-down interview?

ROHAN VIJAYAN, 29, Pennsylvania

This software engineer backed Democrats in the last two elections but remains
undecided in 2024.

Harris can speak coherently, which I think is just an upgrade from the prior
two candidates, both Trump and Biden. I think she\'s relatively eloquent in
the way that she talks. But in terms of policy, this was the first time I
think I’ve actually heard some elements of substantive policy from her.

The interview didn\'t do a whole lot to assuage my concerns - what she’d
actually want to do and whether she\'d be able to effectively implement it.
You’ve been VP for a few years, why haven\'t you attempted these things
before?

The interview didn’t change my mind on how to vote. To be honest, I want to
see her challenged in a press conference or obviously the debate that\'s
coming up. I think I need to see her in that kind of a setting, without a
teleprompter or rehearsed answers. I think the interview was a little too
coddled. I want to see her put under some pressure. I don\'t think she\'s done
too well in the past as the VP in those situations.

Walz came across as very personable. I think he helps kind of instill a sense
of this good old American, kind of down-to-earth feeling that I think was
missing from her in particular. I do like his addition to the ticket.

JEREMY PETERSEN, 26, Utah

A teacher who voted for the Green Party in 2020, Jeremy felt Harris’s message
lacked conviction.

I feel they\'ve been very vague. I understand why, to a degree, from their
perspective that it\'s more ‘Let\'s make this about Donald Trump,’ rather than
about policy. But that only gets you so far.

I was frustrated with her for saying the phrase ‘My values have not changed,
but my policies have.’ If you were consistent on your values, if you want
clean energy, then you would still be in favour of the ban on fracking.

When they talked about the Israel and Gaza she said we\'re going to maintain
the Biden administration policy. It\'s a policy that, at least to me, has
failed both Jews and Palestinians. People on both sides seem to be no closer
to a deal and people on both sides continue to suffer. So saying we\'re going
to maintain a policy that has gotten nowhere in almost a year feels almost
like she\'s rather just trying to not lose voters rather than say I\'m going
to work towards a solution.

I didn’t hear enough to persuade me yet. Because it feels like, on one hand,
she\'s saying, we\'ll be different to Biden, but on the other hand, it\'s also
like it\'s just going to be the same with a new face.

EDWARD GREENE, 22, New Hampshire

A student who did not vote last time, he feels lost since his favourite
candidate, Robert Kennedy Jr, endorsed Trump.

I wasn\'t particularly impressed, to be honest. I don\'t think the interview
revealed much. I also understand that’s sort of politics, and that\'s going to
be true of any given campaign, that the more specific they get, the easier it
is to campaign against them.

I appreciated when Harris specifically was talking about her planned measures
for economic reform and this opportunity economy she was talking about. But I
don’t think it was particularly compelling or the questions were particularly
challenging.

I\'m not sure if anything in it would convince me to vote for the Harris-Walz
campaign. One of the big reasons people were excited for Harris taking over
the ticket - after Biden was so bad in live, unscripted environments - was
that she was young and she might infuse more energy into the Democratic
campaign. But because of the lack of live interviews and answering questions
so far I still have concerns about their competency.
